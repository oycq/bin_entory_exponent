`python entroy.py` train with multiprocesses
`python entroy_single_thread.py` train with single process # old version not recommend
`python entropy_speed_test.py` check speed
   171.613  0.318  0.05 0.004 61.052  0.02 in aliyun
`python entropy_accurate_test.py` use labels table generated by 
                                  train dataset to caculate accurate
                                  in both train and teest dataset

multiprocesses speed = singe process * cpu_processes

however this version still has speed problem, time = k * n ** 2( need 2 hours to run when n == 8)
